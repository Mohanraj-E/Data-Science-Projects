# 🤖 Fine-Tuning a Language Model on IMDb Dataset

This project demonstrates how to **fine-tune** a pre-trained language model using the **IMDb dataset** and Hugging Face's Transformers and Datasets libraries.

⚠️ **Goal:**  
The focus is on fine-tuning a model to generate text based on movie reviews, but the approach can be adapted for other domains by using different datasets.

## 📌 What is Fine-Tuning?

**Fine-tuning** is the process of adjusting a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-2) on a specific dataset to make it more suitable for a particular task, such as sentiment analysis, text generation, or even specialized content creation.

## 🚀 How the Fine-Tuning Process Works

### 🔷 1. Load and Preprocess the Dataset
- The IMDb dataset is loaded using **HuggingFace Datasets**.
- Text data is cleaned by removing newlines and other unnecessary characters.

### 🔷 2. Tokenize the Data
- The pre-trained tokenizer (e.g., **distilgpt2**) is used to convert text into tokenized sequences.
- Padding and truncation are applied to ensure consistent sequence lengths across the dataset.

### 🔷 3. Prepare the Model
- A pre-trained language model (**distilgpt2**) is loaded using **HuggingFace Transformers**.
- The tokenizer’s padding token is set to the end-of-sequence token to ensure compatibility during training.

### 🔷 4. Split the Dataset
- The dataset is split into training and evaluation sets (typically 80% for training and 20% for evaluation).

### 🔷 5. Fine-Tune the Model
- The model is fine-tuned using the training data with **HuggingFace’s Trainer** class.
- Hyperparameters such as batch size and the number of epochs are defined, and training is executed.

### 🔷 6. Generate Text from a Prompt
- After fine-tuning, the model can generate text based on a user-provided prompt.

## 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
$ python fine_tune_model.py

Enter a prompt for text generation: Acting
Generated text: Acting is the art of performing in a theatrical production. It involves bringing characters to life through the use of speech, body language, and emotions.
