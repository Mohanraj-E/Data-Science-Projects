# E-Mail Verification
In this project I created and train the Machine learning Model to verify the incoming Mail i.e in this case an user input and report whether it is Spam or Not-Spam.  

I have performed data preprocessing like:

  1. Created a column using one hot encoding
  
  2. Split the data into Train and Test datasets
  
  3. Using sklearn.model --> train_test_split
  
  4. Creating a model which Accepts user input and determine wether it is Spam or Not Spam
